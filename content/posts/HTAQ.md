## Introduction
- The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn't, we wouldn't be here. If you give us an interesting question to chew on we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise. Among hackers, “Good question!” is a strong and sincere compliment.

#### Use meaningful, specific subject headers
***Stupid:***
    HELP! Video doesn't work properly on my laptop!

***Smart:***
    X.org 6.8.1 misshapen mouse cursor, Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset

***Smarter:***
    X.org 6.8.1 mouse cursor on Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset - is misshapen

#### RTFM ve STFW: How To Tell You've Seriously Screwed Up
- There is an ancient and hallowed tradition: if you get a reply that reads “RTFM”, the person who sent it thinks you should have Read The Fucking Manual. He or she is almost certainly right. Go read it.

- RTFM has a younger relative. If you get a reply that reads “STFW”, the person who sent it thinks you should have Searched The Fucking Web. He or she is almost certainly right. Go search it. (The milder version of this is when you are told “Google is your friend!”)

## Questions Not To Ask
- Where can I find program or resource X?
- How can I use X to do Y?
- How can I configure my shell prompt?
- Can I convert an AcmeCorp document into a TeX file using the Bass-o-matic file converter?
- My {program, configuration, SQL statement} doesn't work
  - This is not a question, and I'm not interested in playing Twenty Questions to pry your actual question out of you — I have better things to do. On seeing something like this, my reaction is normally of one of the following:
      - do you have anything else to add to that?
      - oh, that's too bad, I hope you get it fixed.
      - and this has exactly what to do with me?
- I'm having problems with my Windows machine. Can you help?
  - Yes. Throw out that Microsoft trash and install an open-source operating system like Linux or BSD.
- My program doesn't work. I think system facility X is broken.
- I'm having problems installing Linux or X. Can you help?
- How can I crack root/steal channel-ops privileges/read someone's e-mail?
  - You're a lowlife for wanting to do such things and a moron for asking a hacker to help you.

## Good and Bad Questions

- Stupid: Where can I find out stuff about the Foonly Flurbamatic?
  - This question just begs for "STFW" as a reply.
- Smart: I used Google to try to find “Foonly Flurbamatic 2600” on the Web, but I got no useful hits. Can I get a pointer to programming information on this device?
  - This one has already STFWed, and sounds like there might be a real problem.

- Stupid: I can't get the code from project foo to compile. Why is it broken?
  - The querent assumes that somebody else screwed up. Arrogant git...
- Smart: The code from project foo doesn't compile under Nulix version 6.2. I've read the FAQ, but it doesn't have anything in it about Nulix-related problems. Here's a transcript of my compilation attempt; is it something I did?
  - The querent has specified the environment, read the FAQ, is showing the error, and is not assuming his problems are someone else's fault. This one might be worth some attention.

- Stupid: I'm having problems with my motherboard. Can anybody help?
  - J. Random Hacker's response to this is likely to be “Right. Do you need burping and diapering, too?” followed by a punch of the delete key.
- Smart: I tried X, Y, and Z on the S2464 motherboard. When that didn't work, I tried A, B, and C. Note the curious symptom when I tried C. Obviously the florbish is grommicking, but the results aren't what one might expect. What are the usual causes of grommicking on Athlon MP motherboards? Anybody got ideas for more tests I can run to pin down the problem?
  - This person, on the other hand, seems worthy of an answer. He/she has exhibited problem-solving intelligence rather than passively waiting for an answer to drop from on high.
